# Bachelor Project: Tactic Interpreter

## Description
This is my Python bachelor project: a tactic interpreter for a programming tutor.  
It receives tactic commands from users and processes them correctly according to the rules.  
The rules can be understood from the descriptions of the functions ending with '_handler' in the 'interpreter.py' file.

## Installation
No external packages are required. The project uses only Python's standard library.

## Usage
Run the main program 'interpreter.py'.  
The main function is 'tutor_loop()'.
